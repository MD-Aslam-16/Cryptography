Light weight Sensor network security algorithm

1. Algorithm get a 512 bit length unmeaningful string (a character come repeatedly)
2.From that string extract  the count of repeated character(First X  only used)
3. Eg :if X is 5,  15 22 8 19 11
4. Execute translation cypher technique for the text using the above key.
       1st char ising 15
        2nd char using 22
       3rd char using 8
       4th char using 19
       5th char using   11
        6th char using 15 ....... and so on
5. we have to use a spl value for the space ie the encrypted characters of the characters befor and after space is repeats 1 time
   eg: text : a e
         encrypted text: g h
          space is represented as : gghh
6. The encryption pattern will use the reverse key after encrypting N number of characters.

In the  above algorithm the values of X, N and length of unmeaningful string are fixed before deploying a Sensor in the field.
The binding process of sensor with head node is initiated by the node it self.
